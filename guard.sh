# src/ split makes a junction safe to create, and the moment one exists every
# write to src/ is a write to the running game's mod.
#
# Files outside src/ -- tests, docs, .git -- are not inside the watched folder,
# which is the whole reason for the split.

# The loader picks up a change within seconds and re-runs the plugin chunk.

# On 2026-08-28 that crashed a live fight: four reloads in ninety seconds, the
# last three seconds before an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION inside Lua's garbage
# collector (lgc.cpp:451 traversetable). Some of those reloads were sabotage
# cycles -- deliberately broken code -- running in the player's actual session.
#
# Source this and call `guard` before any write to main.lua.
